## 🌍 Cloud Atlas OS

We’ve evolved **Crowd Engineering** into a revolutionary **Social Network application**.

<strong>Cloud Atlas OS</strong> is a <strong>real-world platform owned by the community</strong> — like a mix of <strong>Google Earth</strong>, <strong>Wikipedia (coming soon)</strong>, and an <strong>App Store (coming soon)</strong> — but without big companies or central servers in control.<br>

It runs on a <strong>network of people's devices</strong>, so it's <strong>scalable</strong>, <strong>doesn’t need servers</strong>, and is <strong>free to use</strong>.<br><br>
It’s fully owned by <strong>you and everyone</strong>, working as a <strong>global public Collective Computer</strong> — a worldwide system owned by everyone, powered by everyone, where data, apps, and smart tools are spread around the world instead of being locked in company systems.

# Creating Your Own Apps with Cloud Atlas:
<h4><strong>For new apps built specifically for Cloud Atlas OS</strong>, you can focus entirely on the front-end, with the back-end taken care of for you. The only consideration is the structure of your database. It’s as simple as building your app and letting Cloud Atlas OS handle the rest.<br><br> <strong>For existing apps, transitioning to Cloud Atlas OS is just as easy.</strong> You’ll only need to replace your back-end driver with ours—typically just three lines of code—allowing your app to integrate seamlessly into the decentralized network without major changes.</h4>

Don’t get hung up on the tools; pick what suits your flow. Elevate your concepts using <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong> (Uses C++ as the primary programming language, with Blueprints for visual scripting, and also supports Python for scripting certain tasks.), <strong>Unity 3D</strong> (Uses C# as the primary programming language, with Unity Visual Scripting (Bolt) for visual scripting.), and/or <strong>HTML, CSS, JS, APIs</strong> (JAMstack), <strong>WASM</strong> (C, C++, C#, and Rust, but for the Web), or <strong>WebContainers</strong> (Node.js in the browser). Then continue with <strong>*Stackblitz IDE Integration (Live Edit)*</strong>

## Stackblitz IDE Integration (Live Edit)
The Stackblitz IDE is seamlessly integrated (settings icon top-right), enabling you to propose, create, and implement new applications, enhancements, and bug fixes directly - in Browser — all without the need for installing a coding environment. Contributions can be made effortlessly via a simple pull request.

## Future App Creation with Cloud Atlas
#### Funding Innovation:
Want to support the development of a feature or app? With Cloud Atlas, you can finance it yourself or rally community support through applying as pop app (so (pop)ular, devs want to code it for free) money and code donations, and/or crowdfunding. This opens up a vast marketplace for development work and incentivizes contributions, democratizing app creation like never before.

#### Free Access to All Updates:
The best part is that all enhancements and new applications are free for every user. Since the creation was donated/paid for by the crowd and the operation on Cloud Atlas is free due to its decentralized nature.

We’re committed to the vast potential of Cloud Atlas and are thrilled to witness its growth as the future of app development.<br><br>

# How to create your idea, app, game, network...?
- clone or LiveEdit (settings-icon top-right)
- npm install
- npm run dev
<br><br>

<img width="1920" height="1048" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f4ca88e-a37d-4e2d-9e90-59e1a505770c" />

##### No framework boilerplate

SvelteJS is not a framework, its more of a WYSIWYG editor and compiler.
https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte

Enjoy the per page/component view, reactive store, and the bind feature of SvelteJS, but code in plain Javascript! (every .svelte file is a page AND a component, based on your usecase. Every file has an area for script, markup, css per page/component)

Blazing fast because the build output is your app precompiled. Static, but reactive! This is SvelteJS/JAMstack, which runs on edge and every other storage. 😝

Simply get started with whatever you can think of. Everything is well pre-configured. In turn you can start to code your idea instant, without thinking about the repo configuration or the back-end. In Javascript, without any framework boilerplate. Only the reactive store and the binds are Sveltejs, but the modifications/extensions can be done by anyone who knows JS without understanding a shred of Sveltejs. (when you see how the form in Brainstorming.svelte works, it will click, promise! 😉😁)<br><br>

# Summarize
This repository is meant as a clean start point for decentralized, location-based apps. I even go so far to say, EVERY APP should be location based! Since everything in reality is happening in the 3D space anyway, we are missing a lot of spatial intelligence and even very positive outcomes/synergies in app logic, compared to our traditional systems today. Unleash your creativity without caring too much about the tools and the back-end scaling (99% "automatically") or locking yourself in!<br>

Don’t get hung up on the tools; pick what suits your flow. Elevate your concepts using <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong> (Uses C++ as the primary programming language, with Blueprints for visual scripting, and also supports Python for scripting certain tasks.), <strong>Unity 3D</strong> (Uses C# as the primary programming language, with Unity Visual Scripting (Bolt) for visual scripting.), and/or <strong>HTML, CSS, JS, APIs</strong> (JAMstack), <strong>WASM</strong> (C, C++, C#, and Rust, but for the Web), or <strong>WebContainers</strong> (Node.js in the browser). Then continue with the settings icon in the top-right and do a pull-request.<br>

Launch your creations to a global audience across various platforms—be it <strong>browsers, mobile devices, desktops, VR, or WebVR, right out of the box.</strong> Enjoy the liberty of creation, supported by a <strong>backend that scales automatically by 99%, free from any restrictive ties.</strong><br><br>

# Cloud Atlas OS: A New Frontier — Turning the World Into Your Operating System

*Revolutionizing how users create, interact with, and govern digital worlds*

Today, we're excited to introduce **Cloud Atlas OS**, a groundbreaking platform that evolves world models into a complete operating system—designed to give users unprecedented power to create, govern, and share. Cloud Atlas OS represents a fundamental shift toward user-owned digital infrastructure, combining real-time interactive world generation with decentralized governance, content creation, and social impact tools.

## A General-Purpose World Model for Everyone

Like advanced world models that generate diverse interactive environments, Cloud Atlas OS provides users with the tools to create, modify, and interact with digital worlds in real time. But where traditional world models stop at simulation, Cloud Atlas OS begins a new chapter: putting the power of world creation directly into users’ hands through intuitive interfaces—democratizing what was once the domain of major tech companies.

Our platform runs on a **self-scaling, zero-cost infrastructure** powered by user devices instead of centralized servers. This ensures that users maintain ownership of their private data through encrypted local storage, while freely sharing creative content with the global community.

## Revolutionary Features Powered by User-Centric Design

**AppWorld Layer**: Instantly turn ideas into apps, games, and experiences with drag-and-drop tools, code, or AI prompts. Say: *“New York, Cyberpunk style, First Person Shooter”*—and instantly generate a monetizable, real-world game.

**Virtual Encyclopedia**: Over 6 million Wikipedia articles become immersive, animated 3D objects and scenes, geolocated on a global map and powered by BitTorrent. Spotting anomalies while exploring—like a green giraffe at Starbucks—automatically flags corrections to the Wikipedia community.

**SWARM Governance**: From voting to doing. Cloud Atlas OS enables brainstorming, petitions, crowdfunding, and collective action through gamified civic modules. Users get paid for addressing issues they care about while building meaningful connections.

**MissionTV**: A streaming platform where users broadcast real-world mission progress, earn tips, and inspire action. We’re creating a new kind of influencer: the *good human*—recognized for doing good and motivating others to do the same.

## An Ecosystem of the Users, By the Users

Cloud Atlas OS is more than a platform—it’s a community-owned ecosystem where 8 billion minds can collectively create:

* **Telecommunication of the users**: Decentralized communication networks
* **App and game stores of the users**: Creator-owned marketplaces without middlemen
* **Economies of the users**: Direct monetization between creators and consumers
* **Governance tools of the users**: Democratic decision-making that scales
* **Incubation of the users**: Crowdsourced business, app, and game development

## Technical Innovation Meets Social Impact

The platform goes far beyond entertainment. Users can leverage our 6 million Wikipedia 3D objects to build real-world, location-based apps and games. The more people explore, the smarter and faster the system becomes—creating a virtuous cycle of improvement and engagement.

Our gamified civic model turns social change into entertainment. Viewers don’t just watch—they fund and participate. This creates sustainable systems for tackling real-world challenges while keeping users engaged and motivated.

## The Future of User Empowerment

Cloud Atlas OS is more than a technological leap—it’s a paradigm shift toward true digital democracy. By merging advanced world modeling with user ownership, decentralized infrastructure, and collaborative governance, we’re laying the foundation for a digital ecosystem that serves users instead of extracting from them.

As we continue to expand, Cloud Atlas OS will grow into user-owned alternatives to major platforms and services—always guided by our principle: **power to the users, profits to the creators, and progress through collective intelligence.**

The future isn’t just about creating better AI—it’s about creating better systems that amplify human potential. With Cloud Atlas OS, we’re not just building technology—**we’re building the world’s first user-owned future.**

**PS: What makes Cloud Atlas OS different is that its AI isn’t a black box—it’s a walkable brain. Our Virtual Encyclopedia doubles as a living neural map where users can literally explore how the AI thinks, spot glitches as easily as a child noticing a misplaced giraffe, and feed it real-time data. This turns world modeling into a collective intelligence—a general AI for the masses, inspired by Buckminster Fuller’s vision of a world peace game.**

# My Journey with Cloud Atlas
I have always been fascinated by the peaceful and knowledge-seeking society depicted in Star Trek. The movie “First Contact” explains the shift from our current society to a post-scarcity society, triggered by the Vulcans’ first contact with humanity. However, the movie never explained what the Vulcans gave humanity to facilitate this transformation. Given our tendency to use new technologies as weapons, I wondered what could possibly have led to such a profound change.<br><br>

The answer, I believe, lies in a collective computer—a resource-based economy management system with a collective knowledge database and collaboration tools. This is what I have been working on for the past seven years: creating The Cloud Atlas, a platform inspired by the idea of The Computer from Star Trek.<br><br>

The Cloud Atlas is designed to enable spontaneous cooperation and innovative problem-solving, making the world work for 100% of humanity without ecological offense or disadvantaging anyone. It allows participants to brainstorm solutions, petition for necessary changes, and crowdfund their initiatives. Whether it’s a local private matter project or a global public initiative, The Cloud Atlas provides the resources and support needed to turn ideas into reality.<br><br>

My journey has been filled with challenges and learning experiences, but each step has brought me closer to realizing a world where collaboration and innovation drive positive change. I believe that by working together, we can create a more connected, proactive, and sustainable future.<br><br>

# The concept was dead simple...
Buckminster Fuller once said, "You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."<br><br>

Ira Chaleff, in his book Intelligent Disobedience: Doing Right When What You're Told to Do Is Wrong, stated, "A function of civil society is to organize ourselves to collectively stand up to those who add to the suffering of others."<br><br>

Inspired by these visions, Cloud Atlas was born: a decentralized platform akin to a global, user-owned Google Earth. Imagine a collective computer similar to the one in the post-scarcity society of Star Trek, and a basic digital government gradually replacing traditional governments. Cloud Atlas empowers users to create micro and large-scale missions, projects, and apps effortlessly.<br><br>

For non-technical users, the platform offers seamless linking to existing infrastructures or resources, whether it's a website, web app, GitHub repository, game on Steam/Epic Games, or even online meetings and live streaming. The possibilities are endless.<br><br>

Developers can extend and customize every aspect, from the UI to elements, using their preferred programming languages or graphical development environments like Unreal Engine 5 and Unity 3D. With CesiumJS services and a range of free tools, visualizing and animating data on the globe becomes straightforward.<br><br>

Trystero ensures decentralized data synchronization in the background via WebRTC and Bittorrent-Signaling, though traditional data persistence methods are also supported out of the box. Cloud Atlas is integrative and flexible, allowing IoT devices, sensors, or any other data sources and devices to be added to the globe or individual pins.<br><br>

Additionally, Cloud Atlas offers digital governance through Crowd Engineering Missions: a sequence of brainstorming, petitioning, crowdfunding, and action events, accelerating the journey from problem to solution to realization, to a fraction of the time compared to traditional governments.<br><br>

Cloud Atlas aims to become the world's united operating system. Whether private or public, local or global, idea generation or conflict resolution, non-profit initiative or profitable enterprise – with Cloud Atlas, anything is possible.<br><br>

Our Main Directive: "Make the world work for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone."<br><br>

# Core Components

### 1. Decentralized Government
A bold reimagining of governance—where **brainstorming, group action, petitioning,** and **crowdfunding** merge into an action-driven system. Whether it’s addressing local challenges or tackling global issues, anyone can create or join missions. It’s governance made accessible, participatory, and even fun—like a game where everyone plays to make the world better.<br><br>
It’s government by doing, not by voting.<br><br>

<br><br>

### 2. Virtual Encyclopedia
6 Million Wikipedia articles sourced into immersive, animated 3D scenes and objects—geolocated on a global map and powered by BitTorrent. The more people use it, the more scalable, faster and rich the content becomes.<br>

Picture a **3D animated Wikipedia** where articles come to life as **interactive objects or scenes roaming the globe**, based on the content of each article.<br>

Truth-checking happens by exploration: users naturally flag anomalies while navigating the world.
Imagine spotting a **green giraffe sipping coffee at Starbucks**—an anomaly that hints at a **factual error or absurdity** in the source Wikipedia article, and automatically **flags a correction request** to the Wikipedia community.<br>

When we transfer all **6 million+ Wikipedia articles** into 3D objects and scenes for the first iteration, the **interaction between articles will reveal inconsistencies and contradictions**, helping to **flag wrong information** throughout the entire Wikipedia.<br>

This feature transforms information into a **living, visual experience**—blending **learning, truth detection, and storytelling** in a gamified, immersive world.<br>

You don’t need to be an expert to help correct the complete knowledge of mankind—you just need **eyes and a brain**.<br><br>

<br><br>

### 3. Community-Driven DApp Store with Integrated Decentralized Back-End
**Universal Developer & Platform Compatibility**  
Developers can create using their preferred tools for all platforms.

**In-Browser Development**  
Create directly in your browser with ease.  
*Did you know? Node.js now runs in browsers!*

**Self-Scaling Apps**  
By leveraging WebRTC and public BitTorrent tracker networks for signaling, dApps scale automatically — eliminating the need for centralized servers.

**Modular, Composable Architecture**
Compatible with any programming language, framework, or tech stack.
This empowers developers to seamlessly build and integrate apps, games, and experiences on our decentralized backend — with backend services already integrated, batteries included.

**🎮 App/Game/Openworld Layer** — Like Figma meets Roblox, but for the real world.<br>
Anyone can build and remix apps, games, and experiences with drag-and-drop tools, code, or AI prompts - Plug into our decentralized backend or bring your own.
Leverage the 6 million Wikipedia 3D objects to build real-world, location-based apps, games and experiences. — e.g., say **“New York, Cyberpunk style, First Person Shooter,”** and instantly generate a monetizable, real-world game in seconds.<br><br>

**Rephrased Disney Quote:**  
*“If you can describe it, you can code it.”*<br><br>

### Cutting out the middlemen
The first developed dApp, **Couchsurfing Free**, sets the stage for what’s possible. Upcoming projects like **dAmazon**, **dUber**, **dUber Eats**, and **dAirBNB** showcase the limitless potential for innovation, cutting out the middlemen. By the (p)eople, for the (p)eople – P2P at its finest.<br><br>

<br><br>

### 4. MissionTV
A decentralized video platform like Twitch — but for real-world impact. Users stream their mission progress, earn tips, and inspire others to act. It’s social change as entertainment, with viewers funding and joining in, live. Fueling social change through engaging video content.
